## Welcome to [wusheng 吴晟](https://github.com/wu-sheng) GitHub Pages

I am a Java **APM Architect** in [OneAPM](http://www.oneapm.com).

My work revolves around distributed systems, distributed tracer, APM, and runtime code generation and manipulation tech. My primary goal is to build an apm/tracer tool, with _High Efficient_, _Professional_, _in distributed-cluster or cloud_. But also **easy** to use. In particular, interested in how to build and diagnose large scale systems with apm tools.
